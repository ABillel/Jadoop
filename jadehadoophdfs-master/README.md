Jadehadoophdfs-master

The realization of the integration between Hadoop and Jade was possible due to the fact that both platforms are Open-source, written in Java, and furthermore,
provide separate Java API’s for building applications using Jade and Hadoop functionalities. 
Incorporating both API’s in a single Java class requires building and running Java agent classes with all the necessary Java archive (jar) libraries.
